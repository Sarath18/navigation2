# Instructions on using Groot
[Groot](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/Groot) is the companion application of [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP) to create, edit, and monitor behavior trees.

##### Note: Currently only supports visualization of the behavior tree along with the creation of new nodes (except ControlNodes) using the Groot. Additional features under development.
